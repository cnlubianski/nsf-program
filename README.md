Welcome to my repository showcasing my preliminary results for my NSF Graduate Fellowship application. This repository contains code, data, and documentation related to my research project. 

The preliminary results were compiled for my presentation I presented to the Risk Analysis Section within the Division of Research and Statistics of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Please see "NSF-Section-Presentation.pdf".
